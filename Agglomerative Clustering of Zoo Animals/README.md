## Zoo Animals - Agglomerative Clustering  
  
Consider the dataset zoo.csv and look at the information provided. The first column denotes the animal name and the last one describes the high level class for the corresponding animals.  
  
You are supposed to find the information for following questions:  
1. Identify unique number of high level classes
2. Perform Agglomerative clustering using 16 intermediate features  
3. Compute mean squared error by comparing the actual high-level class and the predicted high level class  
  
In a nutshell, you need to perform Agglomerative clustering with the appropriate MSE value
