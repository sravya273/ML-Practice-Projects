## Agglomerative Clustering on Iris dataset

In this project, we perform Agglomerative clustering aka Hierarchical Clustering on Iris dataset which is Unsupervised learning.   
Later, Accuracy of the model is calculated using original labels

#### Steps involved:  
1. Import libraries and the dataset  
2. Check for missing values  
3. Extract the features necessary for clustering (or Perform PCA to reduce the dimentionality)  
4. Fit Agglomerative clustering model on feature data  
5. Predict the labels  
6. Visualize the results  
7. Find RMSE of the model
