Imagine, you are solving a classification problem with highly imbalanced class. The majority class is observed 99% of times in the training data. Your model has 99% accuracy after taking the predictions on test data. Which of the following is true in such a case? 1. Accuracy metric is not good for imbalanced class problem. 2. Accuracy metric is good for imbalanced class problem. 3. Precision and recall metrics are good for imbalanced class problem. 4. Precision and recall metrics aren’t good for imbalanced class problem.

A.1 and 3
B.1 and 4

EXPLANATION

Accuracy should not be used as a measure of performance because 96% (as given) might only be predicting majority class correctly, but our class of interest is minority class (4%). Hence, you should use confusion matrix and F measure to determine class-wise performance of the classifier.
