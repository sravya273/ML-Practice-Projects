## Cluster based Incentivization

Lith-ion power is the largest producer of electric vehicle batteries. They provide batteries on rent to e-vehicle drivers. Driver rent a battery typically for a day and there after replace it with a charged battery from the company.
Lith-ion power has variable pricing model based on drivers driving history. Battery life depends on factors such as over speeding, distance driven per day etc. You are supposed to create a cluster model where drivers can be grouped together based on driving data and group the data points so that drivers will be incentivized based on the cluster.

#### Steps:  
1. Import libraries and dataset  
2. Fit k-means model on dataset  
3. Evaluate the cluster centers and labels  
4. Plot the cluster to see distribution of datapoints  
5. Iterate the same by changing clusters to 4  
6. Evaluate the clusters to see distribution of datapoints  
7. Plot the clusters to see distribution of data points
