## Internation Airline Passengers - Time Series Analyis
  
We are given dataset which consists of monthly totals of international airline passengers from 1949 - 1960.  
The objective of this analysis and modeling is to review time series theory. Follow ARIMA model procedure of AirPassengers dataset as follows:  
1. Perform exploratory data analysis  
2. Decomposition of data  
3. Test the stationarity
  
#### Part-B  
4. Plot ACF / PACF andfind (p,d,q) parameters
5. Build ARIMA model  
6. Make predictions using ARIMA model
